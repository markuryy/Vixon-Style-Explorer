# Vixon Style Explorer

Vixon Style Explorer is a temporary Chrome extension that improves the user interface for navigating Vixon's Lora styles on the CivitAI website. This extension addresses the issue of Vixon's unwillingness to cooperate with the community's requests to limit the number of versions in a single model post, which causes harm to versions listed later in the list and makes navigation difficult with the current UI.

## Background

Vixon is a talented Lora creator who has contributed numerous styles to the CivitAI community. However, despite requests from the community, Vixon continues to add new versions to the same model post, resulting in an excessive number of versions that are difficult to navigate using the website's current user interface.

This extension serves as a temporary fix until CivitAI implements a limit on the number of versions allowed in a single model or enhances their UI to better accommodate this behavior.

## Features

- Lists Vixon's Lora styles vertically without the custom scrolling container
- Hides the left and right navigation buttons
- Provides a more user-friendly and accessible way to explore Vixon's styles

## Installation

### ~~From the Chrome Web Store~~ (Pending Approval)
1. ~~Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) and search for "Vixon Style Explorer".~~
2. ~~Click on "Add to Chrome" to install the extension.~~

> **Note:** This extension is targeted towards a niche audience and may not get approved in the Chrome Web Store due to its limited appeal. However, you can still proceed with the manual installation method mentioned below.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the extension files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/markuryy/vixon-style-explorer).
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, it will automatically apply the improved UI when you visit Vixon's model page on the CivitAI website. The Lora styles will be listed vertically, and the left and right navigation buttons will be hidden, making it easier to explore and find the desired style.

## Disclaimer

This extension is a temporary solution and may stop working if CivitAI makes significant changes to their website structure. We encourage CivitAI to address the issue of excessive versions in a single model post and enhance their UI to provide a better user experience for the community.
